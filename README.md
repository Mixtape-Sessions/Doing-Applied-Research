## About

This course is intended to be a practical guide for early career economists doing applied research. The nuts and bolts of coming up with viable research topics, writing, publishing, and service to the profession are covered in two half-day sessions, each lasting roughly four hours (including short breaks). We begin by providing tips on selecting a research topic, doing a comprehensive literature search, and “pitching” your results. Next, we go through the publication process from choosing a journal to effectively responding to the comments of editors and reviewers. We wrap up by discussing networking, refereeing for economics journals, and getting the most out of conferences and departmental seminars. Each half-day session ends with an optional 30-minute Q&A about the academic job market.

#### Section 1. Starting Your Research Project

1. What makes a research question viable?

   - The three hurdles:

     \(i\) Is it interesting/important/policy relevant? How do you figure
     this out?
    
     \(ii\) Are you filling a clearly defined gap in the literature? How do
     you know?
    
     \(iii\) Are the data available?

2. When to cut the cord

   - When to give up on a project and when to pivot

   - How long to spend on a project before calling it quits

   - Zero is a number too (but not an uninteresting zero or a noisy zero!)

3. Managing your research projects

   - Allocating effort across multiple projects

   - When to target a non-economics journal (e.g., a medical journal)

   - Targeting journals early in the research process

#### Section 2. Practical Tips for Writing Your Applied Paper
